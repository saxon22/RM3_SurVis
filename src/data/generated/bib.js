    "ChallengesandIssuesinSentimentAnalysis": {
        "abstract": "Sentiment analysis, a specialization of natural language processing (NLP), has witnessed significant progress since its emergence in the late 1990s, owing to the swift advances in deep learning techniques and the abundance of vast digital datasets. Though sentiment analysis has reached a relatively advanced stage in the area of NLP, it is erroneously assumed that sentiment analysis has reached its pinnacle, leaving no room for further improvement. However, it is important to acknowledge that numerous challenges that require attention persist. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of sentiment analysis, including its applications, approaches to sentiment classification, and commonly used evaluation metrics. The survey primarily focuses on the challenges associated with different types of data for sentiment classification, namely cross-domain data, multimodal data, cross-lingual data, and small-scale data, and provides a review of the state-of-the-art in sentiment analysis to address these challenges. The paper also addresses the challenges faced during sentiment classification irrespective of the type of data available. It aims at a better understanding of sentiment analysis to enable practitioners and researchers select suitable methods for sentiment classification depending on the type of data being analyzed.",

        "abstract": "We propose a deep learning method for eventdriven stock market prediction. First, events are extracted from news text, and represented as dense vectors, trained using a novel neural tensor network. Second, a deep convolutional neural network is used to model both short-term and long-term influences of events on stock price movements. Experimental results show that our model can achieve nearly 6% improvements on S&P 500 index prediction and individual stock prediction, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods. In addition, market simulation results show that our system is more capable of making profits than previously reported systems trained on S&P 500 stock historical data.",

    "EvaluationofSentimentAnalysisinFinance": {
        "abstract": "Financial and economic news is continuously monitored by financial market participants. According to the efficient market hypothesis, all past information is reflected in stock prices and new information is instantaneously absorbed in determining future stock prices. Hence, prompt extraction of positive or negative sentiments from news is very important for investment decision-making by traders, portfolio managers and investors. Sentiment analysis models can provide an efficient method for extracting actionable signals from the news. However, financial sentiment analysis is challenging due to domain-specific language and unavailability of large labeled datasets. General sentiment analysis models are ineffective when applied to specific domains such as finance. To overcome these challenges, we design an evaluation platform which we use to assess the effectiveness and performance of various sentiment analysis approaches, based on combinations of text representation methods and machine-learning classifiers. We perform more than one hundred experiments using publicly available datasets, labeled by financial experts. We start the evaluation with specific lexicons for sentiment analysis in finance and gradually build the study to include word and sentence encoders, up to the latest available NLP transformers. The results show improved efficiency of contextual embeddings in sentiment analysis compared to lexicons and fixed word and sentence encoders, even when large datasets are not available. Furthermore, distilled versions of NLP transformers produce comparable results to their larger teacher models, which makes them suitable for use in production environments.",

        "abstract": " Purpose The goal of the study is to examine the effects of management discussion and analysis (MD&A) sentiment in public companies' annual reports on corporate investment incentives in developing economies. Design/methodology/approach The authors use sentiment analysis of MD&A texts based on Loughran and McDonald (2011) and combination of panel data regression, logit model and random forest. The text data consists of 3,511 annual reports of Chinese listed companies for the period from 2010 to 2019. Findings This paper provides empirical evidence of signaling theory that sentiment of annual reports and MD&A influences corporate decisions on both M&A and internal investments. The authors found that comparing to annual reports MD&A sentiment has more stable and significant explanatory and predictive power. Practical implications This paper confirms the importance of MD&A sentiment for corporate investment decision taking and provides practical techniques for analysts and researchers to study corporate investment incentives from the point of view of signaling theory. Originality/value The study aims to expand the domains of signaling theory and corporate investment valuation by including a broader range of data on companies' M&A and internal investments in developing economies. To explore the impact of MD&A sentiment on corporate investment, a state-of-the-art set of text mining and machine learning techniques is used. The authors' results confirm that MD&A has signaling effect and can get a positive market response. Furthermore, this study enhances the empirical evidence of overconfidence theory, i.e. optimistic management whose MD&A tend to positive overestimates the management's investments decision and also underestimate the potential risk to the firm.",

        "abstract": " Transparency in financial reporting is crucial for maintaining trust in financial markets, yet fraudulent financial statements remain challenging to detect and prevent. This study introduces a novel approach to detecting financial statement fraud by applying sentiment analysis to analyse the textual data within financial reports. This research aims to identify patterns and anomalies that might indicate fraudulent activities by examining the language and sentiment expressed across multiple fiscal years. The study focuses on three companies known for financial statement fraud: Wirecard, Tesco, and Under Armour. Utilising Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the research analyses polarity (positive or negative sentiment) and subjectivity (degree of personal opinion) within the financial statements, revealing intriguing patterns. Wirecard showed a consistent tone with a slight decrease in 2018, Tesco exhibited marked changes in the fraud year, and Under Armour presented subtler shifts during the fraud years. While the findings present promising trends, the study emphasises that sentiment analysis alone cannot definitively detect financial statement fraud. It provides insights into the tone and mood of the text but cannot reveal intentional deception or financial discrepancies. The results serve as supplementary information, enriching traditional financial analysis methods. This research contributes to the field by exploring the potential of sentiment analysis in financial fraud detection, offering a unique perspective that complements quantitative methods. It opens new avenues for investigation and underscores the need for an integrated, multidimensional approach to fraud detection.",

        "abstract": "Stock market prediction has become an attractive investigation topic due to its important role in economy and beneficial offers. There is an imminent need to uncover the stock market future behavior in order to avoid investment risks. The large amount of data generated by the stock market is considered a treasure of knowledge for investors. This study aims at constructing an effective model to predict stock market future trends with small error ratio and improve the accuracy of prediction. This prediction model is based on sentiment analysis of financial news and historical stock market prices. This model provides better accuracy results than all previous studies by considering multiple types of news related to market and company with historical stock prices. A dataset containing stock prices from three companies is used. The first step is to analyze news sentiment to get the text polarity using na\u00efve Bayes algorithm. This step achieved prediction accuracy results ranging from 72.73% to 86.21%. The second step combines news polarities and historical stock prices together to predict future stock prices. This improved the prediction accuracy up to 89.80%.",

        "abstract": "Many researches have exploited textual data, such as news, online blogs, and financial reports, in order to predict stock price movements effectively. Previous studies formed the task as a classification problem predicting upward or downward movement of stock prices from text documents. Such an approach, however, may be deemed inappropriate when combined with sentiment analysis. In financial documents, same words may convey different sentiments across different sectors; if documents from multiple sectors are learned simultaneously, performance can deteriorate. Therefore, we conducted sentiment analysis of 8-K financial reports of firms sector by sector. In particular, we also employed distributed representation for predicting stock price movements. Experiment results show that our approach improves prediction performance by 25.4% over the baseline model, and that the direction of post-announcement stock price movements shifts accordingly with the polarity of the sentiment of reports. Not only does our model improve predictability, but also provides visualizations, which may assist agents actively trading in the field with understanding the drivers for the observed stock movements. The two main aspects of our model, predictability and interpretability, will provide meaningful insights to help decision-makers in the industry with time-split trading decisions or data-driven detection of promising companies.",

        "abstract": "Behavioral economics tells us that emotions can profoundly affect individual behavior and decision-making. Does this also apply to societies at large, i.e. can societies experience mood states that affect their collective decision making? By extension is the public mood correlated or even predictive of economic indicators? Here we investigate whether measurements of collective mood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time. We analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs. negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time series by comparing their ability to detect the public's response to the presidential election and Thanksgiving day in 2008. A Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public mood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time series, are predictive of changes in DJIA closing values. Our results indicate that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of specific public mood dimensions but not others. We find an accuracy of 86.7% in predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of the DJIA and a reduction of the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) by more than 6%.",
